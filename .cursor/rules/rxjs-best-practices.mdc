- Use pipeable operators for better readability and performance
- Subscribe to observables in the component's ngOnInit lifecycle hook
- Unsubscribe from observables in ngOnDestroy to prevent memory leaks
- Use shareReplay() for sharing observable results across multiple subscribers
- Utilize async pipe in templates to automatically handle subscriptions
- Implement proper error handling in observable chains
- Use appropriate operators for transforming data streams
- Consider using Subject variants (BehaviorSubject, ReplaySubject) when needed
- Implement proper cleanup with takeUntil or other completion strategies
- Document complex observable chains with marble diagrams
